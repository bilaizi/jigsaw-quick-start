# Java Module System Quick-Start Guide

This repository is based on Project Jigsaw's [Module System Quick-Start Guide](http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jigsaw/quick-start). The sections there have been reworked here into a series of commits and runnable code, each demonstrating a key aspect of Java's new module system.

Along the way, you'll transform a traditional Java main class into a _Java module_ that makes use of all the major features Jigsaw has to offer. Each step can be run using the `step.sh` script, but the steps can also simply be read in order using `git log`. See below for instructions on both approaches.
